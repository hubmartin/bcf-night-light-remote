This project is a night lamp for your bed. You can change the brightness of the LED strip by encoder. The turning on and off can be done also from REMOTE unit which can be comfortably placed near the dorr. So you can turn the night light on before you switch off the main room light.

This project consists of BASE unit with Power Module, WS2812 RGBW LED strip, Encoder Module and REMOTE unit with Core Module and Battery Module.

Please check the other BASE/REMOTE repository for other module firmware.
